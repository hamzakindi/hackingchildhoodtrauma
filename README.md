# Can a hacker hack his childhood trauma?

# Background
This project is in response to the following paper: Can biologist fix a radio? (https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S1535-6108(02)00133-2)
On Linkedin, I proposed to Yuri that I will write the paper titled, 'Can hackers understand Amoeba?' once I get a hold of my trauma. In his paper he pointed out the need for a common language for biologists like we have in engineering. In my paper I want apply the approach hackers follow to understand a biological system and report my findings. I have a gut feeling that approaches use in hacking are more suitable for doing biology. Here hacker I mean engineers that dismantle existing systems to understand them and reverse engineer them.
While using the 6+4 approach to problem solving that I have developed recently, I decided to focus on hacking my trauma instead since this is directly related to me right now. I am aware that from biology, my focus has shifted to psychology. And the two are not the same. But I feel hacking my childhood trauma will be more fruitful for me compared to understanding Ameoba as trauma is impacting my day to day life.

I decided to host it on github because this is how we work on open source projects.

I am following the hot roder sprit here as well. This video sum it up beautifully. That is pretty much the same sprit I see in hackers' culture too.

Another approach I am throwing in the mix here is participatory design. Here, for truama, the 'customers' will be self, exiles, firefighters and managers. I am not going to supress any of their voices. I am going keep all of them on board and include them in this hack as collaborators.
